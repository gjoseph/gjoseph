## ✨ Hello

I use Github mostly for completely personal pet-projects that never truly get done or published.

My most "popular" (⭐) repo is one where I took over BarbaryWatchService, because the author stopped maintaining it; I wanted to port it to work with the WatchService SPI. Meanwhile, my need to that library was gone, so I never finished that either. I do finish things, though. Just probably not here.
